                <h2>Interview Q&A</h2>
                <h3>Q: Tell us about yourself.</h3>
                <p>A: I am a versatile problem-solver who started in psychology, gained some IT skills in systems support, and advanced into full-stack software development. My unique strength is bridging technical problem-solving with user-centered design, creating solutions that are both functional and intuitive.</p>
                <h3>Q: What are your biggest strengths?</h3>
                <p>A: My greatest strengths are intellectual curiosity, cross-disciplinary problem-solving, and an ethical approach to development. For example, my JavaScript-based OS emulator project demonstrates my ability to integrate technical skills with user-centered design principles from psychology, creating intuitive interfaces. My persistence in mastering complex topics, like system administration and web development, allows me to tackle challenges systematically, while my commitment to Thomistic ethics ensures I prioritize user trust and integrity in every project.</p>
                <h3>Q: Where do you see yourself starting in tech?</h3>
                <p>A: My first realistic entry point is a Junior Web Developer role, where I can leverage my portfolio projects and certifications. I‚Äôve already built this OS emulator as my first portfolio project, and I‚Äôm focused on polishing 3‚Äì5 projects that showcase HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.</p>
                <h3>Q: What is your biggest weakness?</h3>
                <p>A: My broad interests sometimes lead to overextension, causing me to juggle multiple projects. I‚Äôm addressing this by using structured time management techniques, such as the Pomodoro method and task prioritization, to focus on high-impact tasks and deliver results more efficiently.</p>
                <h3>Q: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h3>
                <p>A: In five years, I envision myself as a lead full-stack developer, specializing in educational technology to create platforms that enhance learning through psychology-informed design. I aim to mentor junior developers, contribute to system architecture, and advocate for ethical software practices, building on projects like the CBT app I am still planning to build, integrating cognitive behavioral theory with accessible technology.</p>
                <h3>Q: How do you handle a challenging technical problem?</h3>
                <p>A: I approach challenging technical problems with a structured, analytical mindset. For instance, while developing the OS emulator‚Äôs process handling system, I encountered issues with memory simulation. I broke the problem into smaller parts, researched JavaScript‚Äôs memory management, tested solutions iteratively, and used debugging tools to identify bottlenecks. My psychology background also helps me consider user impact, ensuring solutions are both technically sound and intuitive. This methodical approach, combined with persistence, ensures I resolve issues effectively.</p>
                <h3>Q: How do you stay updated with new technologies?</h3>
                <p>A: I stay updated by combining structured learning with practical application. I follow platforms like GitHub and FreeCodeCamp for emerging trends, and complete courses. I also build projects to experiment with new tools like ES6 features or Django. This hands-on approach, driven by my intellectual curiosity, ensures I keep pace with the fast-evolving tech landscape.</p>
                <h3>Q: How do you handle learning new technologies?</h3>
                <p>A: I break down concepts using the 80/20 principle: focus first on the fundamentals that drive most of the outcomes, then iterate with project-based learning.</p>
                <h3>Q: Why should we hire you at entry-level?</h3>
                <p>A:I bring a rare mix of technical foundation, cross-disciplinary problem-solving, and ethical reasoning. While I‚Äôm entry-level, I‚Äôm strategic about growth: I‚Äôve mapped a clear trajectory from junior web development to full-stack expertise, and I‚Äôm committed to building solutions that are not only functional but also ethical and human-centered.</p>
                
                <h3>Q: How do you prioritize tasks when working on multiple projects?</h3>
                <p>A: To manage multiple projects, I use a prioritization framework based on impact and deadlines. I assess tasks by their contribution to project goals and urgency, I focus on high-priority items. This approach mitigates my tendency to overextension, ensuring timely delivery while maintaining quality across projects.</p>
                <h3>Q: How do you approach debugging a complex issue in a web application?</h3>
                <p>A: When debugging a web application, I follow a systematic process. I start by reproducing the issue, then use browser dev tools to inspect network requests and console logs. I isolate the problem to an incorrect query index, verify it for an explain plan, and optimize the query. My psychology background also guides me to consider user-facing impacts, ensuring fixes enhance usability. This structured approach ensures efficient and effective debugging.</p>
                <h3>Q: How would you troubleshoot a network connectivity issue in a Windows Server environment?</h3>
                <p>A: To troubleshoot a network connectivity issue in a Windows Server 2016 environment, I start by verifying the issue‚Äôs scope using ping and tracert to test connectivity. For example, during my Systems Support Learnership, I diagnosed a server unable to reach a client device. I checked the server‚Äôs network configuration with ipconfig, ensured the correct subnet and gateway settings, and used netstat to monitor active connections. I also inspected firewall rules and tested physical connections. This methodical process, combined with my analytical skills, ensures quick resolution while maintaining system reliability.</p>
                
                <h3>Q: How do you ensure code quality in your development projects?</h3>
                <p>A: To ensure code quality, I follow best practices like writing modular, readable code and using version control with Git/GitHub for collaboration and review. In my OS emulator project, I implemented tests for JavaScript modules and adhered to linting standards with ESLint to catch errors early. Drawing on my FNB Bootcamp training, and leverage certifications like FreeCodeCamp‚Äôs JavaScript algorithms to refine my skills.</p>
                <h3>Q: How would you optimize a virtualized environment on Windows Server 2016 for better performance?</h3>
                <p>A: To optimize a virtualized environment on Windows Server 2016, I focus on resource allocation and system configuration. During my Systems Support Learnership, I worked with Hyper-V to manage virtual machines. For example, I adjusted CPU and memory allocation to prevent overprovisioning, used dynamic memory for efficient resource use, and configured storage with VHDX files for better performance. I also ensured proper network settings, like enabling virtual switches for efficient communication, and monitored performance with tools like Performance Monitor. This approach, rooted in my analytical skills, maximizes system efficiency and reliability.</p>
