# Operating-System-From-Scratch
A browser-based OS emulator built using JS without any frameworks. It simulates core OS functionalities. Serves as a learning platform to explore OS concepts, including:
CPU instruction evaluation
Built-in applications like Calculator and Notepad
Custom scripting engine with variables, conditionals, and loops
GUI terminal and OS-style desktop interface
(Optional) Django Backend for authentication, file persistence, and session management

This project serves as a learning platform to explore OS concepts in a high-level environment, simulating how real OSes handle memory, processes, files, and user interaction.
